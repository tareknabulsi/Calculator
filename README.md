This was a quick project to get more familiar with concepts in Swift and Xcode. I got some practice using stack views to organize the storyboard contents and to gain flexibility when switching between portrait and landscape views. This project also got me very familiar with optional types and how they can be effective. It definitely saves a lot of headaches not having to check for null values since Swift allows optionals to be assigned to a default value when they are null. Another tricky aspect was getting the calculator logic to work smoothly. Although tricky, it was definitley enjoyable.
